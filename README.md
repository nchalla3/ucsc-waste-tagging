# UCSC Waste Tagging App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is the initial MVP of a project tasked to me from the UCSC Sustainability Office: the ultimate goal is an AI-powered application to help with campus waste audits. My initial plan is to start by creating a simple mobile application where users can upload a variety of images of campus trash and tag it with data regarding the types of contaminants/waste in the dumpsters. The goal is to crowdsource this app to sustainability-motivated UCSC students, with the idea of creating a large dataset to train an AI model that can eventually perform this analysis independent of manual tagging.
