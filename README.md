# UCSC Waste Tagging App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is the initial MVP of a project tasked to me by the UCSC Sustainability Office: an AI-powered waste auditing application that uses machine learning to assist in determining the state of campus waste sorting. 

My initial plan is to start by creating a simple mobile application where users can upload a variety of images of campus trash and tag it with data regarding the types of contaminants/waste in the dumpsters. The goal is to crowdsource this app to sustainability-motivated UCSC students, with the idea of creating a large dataset to train an AI model that can eventually perform this analysis independent of manual tagging.

From here, I will create a model trained on the aforementioned data to be able to utilize computer vision to automatically determine the levels of contamination in a given campus dumpster using PyTorch and TensorFlow to get a better understanding of how accurately garbage and recycling are sorted in their respective bins on campus
